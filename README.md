# Dual-Opamp-Proto-Board

Simple soic-8 opamp prototyping board for use with a breadboard. 

Both VCC and VEE have pads for 2 decoupling caps (0805 and 1206, TH is possible too). The VCC, VEE and GND traces have 0805 pads inline for either small value resistors, ferrite beads or you can just jump them with a 0R jumper or solder jumper.
